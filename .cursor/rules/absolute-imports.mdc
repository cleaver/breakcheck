# Use these path aliases:
#   @      → src
#   @api   → src/api
#   @cli   → src/cli
#   @core  → src/core
#   @lib   → src/lib
#   @project-types → src/types
# For files in the same directory, always use a relative import (e.g., ./file).
# Only use path aliases for cross-directory imports.

rule: 
  - Use `@`, `@api`, `@cli`, `@core`, `@lib`, and `@project-types` path aliases for imports matching their respective directories, except when importing from the same directory.
  - For same-directory imports, always use relative paths (e.g., `./file`).
